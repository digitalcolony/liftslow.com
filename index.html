          Lift Slow is a fitness portal for learning how to increase your
          strength and fitness by lifting weights in a controlled slow manner.
          This differs from other strength protocols which use higher-speed or
          higher-reps to gain strength. By slowing the movement you can get just
          as strong while being kind to your joints and minimizing injury risk.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lift Slow was inspired by the principles of
          <a

            target="_blank"
            >High-Intensity Training</a
          >, but with a focus for beginners. Lift Slow stresses learning safe
          exercises and getting started over intensity. Intensity comes with
          time and practice and is not as necessary to make initial progress.

          Lift Slow is by
          <a href="https://criticalmas.org" target="_blank"
            >Michael Allen Smith</a
          >, a fitness enthusiast that discovered slow lifting in 2011 after
          many years of traditional weightlifting. His strength went up, but
          more importantly, he stopped getting injured in the gym.

          This site was created because although there are tremendous amounts of
          resources for intermediate and advanced strength athletes, there was
          very little written on slow lifting for the person just getting
          started.
