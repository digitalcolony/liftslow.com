            <p>Lift Slow is a fitness portal for learning how to increase your strength and fitness by lifting weights in a controlled
                slow manner. This differs from other strength protocols which use higher-speed or higher-reps to gain strength.
                By slowing the movement you can get just as strong while being kind to your joints and minimizing injury
                risk. </p>
            <p>Lift Slow was inspired by the principles of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_training" target="_blank">High-Intensity Training</a>, 
                but with a focus for beginners. Lift Slow stresses learning
                safe exercises and getting started over intensity. Intensity comes with time and practice and is not as necessary
                to make initial progress. </p>
            <h2 class="h3">About Lift Slow</h2>
            <p>Lift Slow is by <a href="https://criticalmas.org" target="_blank">Michael Allen Smith</a>, a fitness enthusiast that 
                discovered slow lifting in 2011 after many years of traditional weightlifting. His strength went up, but more 
                importantly, he stopped getting injured in the gym.</p>
            <p>This site was created because although there are tremendous amounts of resources for intermediate and advanced
                strength athletes, there was very little written on slow lifting for the person just getting started. </p>
            <p>This site just launched. We will be building out content in the next few months.</p>
